## ðŸ“‹ Usage Example

```dart
// In a ViewModel or Controller
final contractService = locator<ContractService>();

// Deposit to flexi save
final txHash = await contractService.flexiDeposit(BigInt.from(1000000)); // 1 USDC

// Get current balance
final balance = await contractService.getFlexiBalance();

// Withdraw from flexi save
final withdrawTx = await contractService.flexiWithdraw(BigInt.from(500000)); // 0.5 USDC
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Required

Before using the contract service, update the contract address in `env_config.dart`:

```dart
static const String savingsVaultContractAddress = '0xYOUR_ACTUAL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE';
```

## ðŸ“Š Contract Functions Available

- `flexi_deposit(amount: u256)` - Deposit USDC to flexi save
- `flexi_withdraw(amount: u256)` - Withdraw USDC from flexi save
- `get_flexi_balance(user: ContractAddress)` - Get current flexi balance
- `get_user_total_deposits(user: ContractAddress)` - Get total deposits
- `get_user_savings_streak(user: ContractAddress)` - Get savings streak
