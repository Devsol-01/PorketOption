# App Crash Fix Progress

## Completed Tasks:
- [x] Updated Android build.gradle.kts with explicit targetSdk 33
- [x] Added proguard rules for Flutter accessibility reflection
- [x] Updated AndroidManifest.xml with proper permissions and compatibility settings
- [x] Configured packaging options to exclude problematic files

## Pending Tasks:
- [ ] Test the app to verify crash fixes
- [ ] Monitor crash logs for any remaining issues
- [ ] Consider updating Flutter dependencies if needed
- [ ] Implement additional error handling if crashes persist

## Next Steps:
1. Run the app to test if accessibility crashes are resolved
2. Check for any remaining compatibility issues
3. Update Flutter packages if newer versions have accessibility fixes
4. Add custom error handling for accessibility features

## Testing Commands:
- `flutter run` - Test the app in debug mode
- `flutter build apk --release` - Test release build
- Check Android logs for any remaining hidden API warnings
